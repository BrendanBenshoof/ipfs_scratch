# ipfs_scratch
Work-space repo, for inter- machine syncing for any files related to IPFS but without a dedicated repo 

I am intending this repo to act as a staging area for projects, and a medium for handling a Todo list, communication, and feedback.

I am treating the issues, as my todo list. Feel free to file an issue on anything that needs addressing (good or bad).
